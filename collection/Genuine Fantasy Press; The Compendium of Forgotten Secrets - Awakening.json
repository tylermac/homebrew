This vulnerability to the influence of the Alrisen, combined with their exotic appearances, makes them outcasts in all but the most welcoming communities. Individuals who would be born tieflings but have their fiendish heritage entirely purged by the influence of the Alrisen would often be classified under the human, elvish, halfling, or dwarvish racial origins instead."

All things end, eventually. Ruin comes in the darkness, watching and waiting for a moment of weakness to begin the gradual corruption and destruction of one's soul and humanity. The Archive is that which waits, and the maledicti are the twisted results of that foul patience, driven mad by the constant scratching of quills upon flesh and the ink that flows through their veins like blood.

These archivists were slaughtered to the last by the monstrosity and dragged to the darkest places below to be subjected to unspeakable ends. The children, however, were left unharmed and trapped in the upper halls, incapable of leaving. Time does not pass properly in the Archive, but the unholy and subtle sentience of the library could not resist the opportunity to create a new and twisted weapon in its endless war against the forces of preservation.",

The scratching of the quills and the war shouts of the fiends filled them with cunning and knowledge of war, while the twisted ink-blood in their veins made them strong and mighty."

Over time, their descendants have managed to gradually free themselves from the virulence of the curse, but more still return to the Archive seeking power. Archivists who have devoted themselves entirely to the ruinous cause of the Accursed Archive are often transformed into maledicti, seeking the frightening strength of fiendish blood for their own purposes, unafraid of the consequences upon their own mind.

Universally, their eyes are pure red, and black veins creep down their face from their tear ducts and the corners of their eyes. Their hands are even more disturbing, always stained black from the ink-blood underneath their skin. Their fingers are sharp and pointed, reminiscent of writing quills or spikes, and they have an unfortunate tendency to use them to scrawl upon surfaces and skin around them. Ink-blood flows smoothly from their fingertips, quickly staining anything they touch a deep and inescapable black. Dark veins run up their forearms, giving them a corrupted appearance. The most disturbing part of a maledicti is their mad and terrifying smile. Each one suffers from some unique insanity, and while most maintain a careful grasp on reality, they can rarely shake the unsettling grin that is the hallmark of their madness."

Most are innocuous in their madness, only descending into psychopathic behavior when their black blood has been spilled upon the ground. Most do not bother to bring about small ruinations, instead working towards ones far grander. Maledicti would agree that toppling a kingdom and sending a civilization into a chaotic spiral towards destruction is much more worthwhile than torturing an enemy or frightening a friend, seeing the latter as beneath them. Ruin is about results, after all."

Maledicti are naturally clever and cunning, leading them to make long and devilish plans even when considering mundane tasks. They are shunned by polite society and must conceal their nature to rise to power or prestige. Those who manage to reach the top are prone to encouraging corruption and dissent in the lower ranks, ruling like tyrants. Not all maledicti are truly evil, nor are all forces of chaos, but the curse laid upon them by the Archive makes them prone to the temptations of dark powers and eldritch rites. Those who shun their heritage are inevitably drawn to adventure, seeking to cause ruin to groups more deserving of their special touch. Many are fond of elaborate tattoos that conceal or highlight their ink-black veins, telling of their deeds using their parchment-like skin as a canvas. Maledicti are often drawn to wizardry, possessing a certain knack for it thanks to their Archival memories, while others favor their fiendish strength to lead them to victory in battle.

Their faces still possess a striking elvish beauty, though the red eyes and black veins reveal their true nature to even the most casual observer. They are welcomed amongst the dark elves, as their propensity for chaos is legendary, and shunned by the others of their kind.",

Their innate cunning allows them to keep up with other gnomes, and their appearances can be explained by magical accidents or dormant curses. Their gnomish heritage allows them to resist the call of their madness better than most, though it remains ever present nonetheless.",

Horns twist into unnatural shapes, and bone spurs erupt through their skin, growing in long ridges along their extremities. Their eyes burn with fiendish fire and eldritch magic, as their already-tainted blood is driven wild by the hellish nature of their lineage. Their mouths are often filled with hundreds of tiny razor-sharp teeth, and their smiles are by far the most disconcerting of any. They always have the hands and feet of a raven, and many are mistaken for harpies from a distance. Tiefling maledicti are horrifying to behold and often the maddest of them all."

The artist must stand before a burning brazier and establish an eldritch connection with the flame, calling upon it to cast light more fervently. Once done, they will place their hands on the far side of the fire, casting a shadow on the wall or ground. While chanting the eerie words and phrases required by this mystical rite, they will use their hands to make a shadow puppet. The chanting corresponds with a story fitting for the personality of the animate image that they desire to summon.",

At the culmination of the event, the warlock will cut a fingertip and place a single drop of blood on the shadow, infusing it with life, soul, and obedience to its creator. "

					"An emberborn is a small, canine-like creature created from ash and burning embers built around a core of molten metal. They are birthed from the pyres of creatures sacrificed to the Ashen Wolf, yet they are often friendly and pleasant to mortals. When provoked, they unleash a blast of ash and smoke before closing in with teeth like red-hot pokers. When at rest, they often sleep within fireplaces and other areas where fires are commonly stoked. They feast on raw meat whenever the opportunity presents itself, and enjoy being presented with gifts of metal and rare wood, as they enjoy devouring both in large quantities.",

There are no reliable records that can prove this belief, but as intelligent elementals they are capable of speech and can thus be asked. As an emberborn feeds and ages, they will grow larger and larger. Some eldritch scholars hypothesize that the Ashen Wolf was once an emberborn, strangely enough.",
					"When summoning an emberborn deliberately, a brazier filled with wood and rare metal is presented and the blood of a sacrificed beast is poured over the open flame as the summoner performs the eldritch incantation. The fire will burn quickly, and when it is reduced to coals, the emberborn will begin to take shape. It will emerge from the fire and demand to be fed. If the summoner provides a drop of their blood to the newly born beast without hesitation, then the emberborn will smile and swear loyalty to their new master. If the summoner does not, then the emberborn will vanish into smoke and seek a forest to ignite instead."

They have an interesting rivalry with the Archive’s record-hunters, and seek to safeguard their secrets from being cataloged in such a mundane fashion as literature. Instead, they hold oral traditions as the highest form of knowledge, and seek to share them in the dreams they visit on the nights of a full moon.",

With these, it called the seas to rise above the land and swallow the entire planet, though the artifacts were destroyed in the process. Countless thousands died that day, and those that remained lived among the corpses and the surf amidst the highest mountaintops. Over time, the Keeper’s unshakable influence over the world grew ever greater, twisting once noble folk into imitations of themselves. They performed rituals over the dead, taking the flesh of their fallen and consuming it themselves. They offered their broken bodies and minds to the Keeper, and it grew ever more powerful.",
					"In the end, it discovered that hearing the whispers of those who worshiped it was pleasing, and so it turned its mind to the lost and ancient arts that allowed one to sculpt life from flesh and sentience from dreams. Thus, the eyeless watchers were born, forever whispering the secrets of those who have come and gone for the entertainment of their inhuman master."

As the ice builds, they let out a piercing cry to summon their master to strike down the target from afar.

They enjoy gifts of carved bone and scrimshaw, which they use to make their nests, and feast upon frozen meat with gusto.",

Then the two will perch upon the body until the snow has taken the heat from it, beginning their feast when the blood begins to freeze.",

They have a strong bond with the other beasts of the Huntsman’s stable, though are haughty and typically view themselves as the most favored of beasts. The steeds may carry, and the hounds may enjoy the master’s affections, but the hawks were the first, and the hawks will be the last. Their pride will lead them to seemingly impossible feats of nighsuicidal bravery, such as tearing the eyes from sorcerers and diving down the throats of dragons to cleave about with their razor-sharp wings."

The beast will emerge from within the fire initially as a serpent of green flame, coiling and hissing with malicious intent. The flaming snake will strike at the offered hand, burning a thin line through the inscribed fang.

They can take an endless number of forms, but they are restricted, unlike their larger kin. These mimics can only choose to turn into objects that appear to be of value. A gold coin, a bill, a gemstone, a necklace of pearls: all of these things are potential wealth mimics. Most of them are asleep, trapped in a singular form. They feign damage or other ill effects while they are sleeping, behaving exactly like natural materials. However, when they are awakened by eldritch magic, they come to life and attack those who sought to own them. Members of the Currency conspiracy often call and awaken wealth mimics using a ritualistic rite, but any warlock of sufficient power and knowledge can summon one.",
					"The first steps are relatively easy. The summoner must ignite the brazier and stand adjacent to it, speaking the correct incantations. Once the fire has burned down to embers, the summoner must insert a single object of value that a wealth mimic could imitate, such as a coin or bank note.",
					"Next, the warlock must offer blood. When a few drops are applied to the object within the brazier, the flames will flare to life once more, consuming the object and then disappearing. The ashes will begin to form together into a shape identical to that of the object, and a new wealth mimic will be born. It will speak a single word, giving itself a name. So long as that name is known by its master, it will obey perfectly, changing shape and killing on command.",
					"Wealth mimics enjoy being fed other currency. Some scholars whisper that this is intended to give them power, but others suspect that they are simply innately cannibalistic. Those in the Conspiracy are believed to have created the wealth mimics with a built-in safety measure, in case something goes wrong with the final plan. In that instance, they would consume one another in a frenzy after being deprived of other flesh, rendering them harmless to those they could not reach."

When they do, consult your character sheet and determine any and all features, spell slots, or class resources that recharge whenever you finish a short or long rest.

This does not apply to hit dice, hit points, or to any features that recover only on a long rest or by another mechanic. No character can recover uses of features that recharge on a short or long rest until after they complete a long rest. They can still spend hit dice to recover hit points during short rests. A long day applies only until you complete a long rest.",

						"Many character classes, such as fighters, warlocks, and monks gain much of their power and utility from the ability to recover essential resources when they finish a short rest. During adventuring days where there is only going to be a single challenging encounter, character classes like wizards, clerics, and barbarians have a distinctive advantage because they are designed with the question of conserving resources in mind. When there's only one fight, they have no reason to conserve resources, and can perform at a higher level than classes that have smaller, more easily recovered abilities. Therefore, if your group has only 1-2 combat encounters each day, it may be beneficial to use the long day rule to make the warlocks and fighters of the group function at the same level as the other classes. Effectively, you've doubled the amount of spell slots a warlock has, the ki points a monk would have, and any other features that any class would have available to it on a short rest basis, such as Channel Divinity or Wild Shape. This allows your group to have singular, climactic encounters with more powerful foes, but makes the party less effective if the adventure has many opportunities to rest. This typically increases the power of classes that rely on short rests in these games, so be sure of the consequences of declaring a long day."

Additionally, Charisma is essential for four core classes, while Intelligence only boasts one. Shifting your warlocks to rely on Intelligence helps to shift their role away from social prowess into intellectual study, and can provide diversity in party abilities from that perspective. It should have a negligible effect on the overall strength of the class in gameplay."

				{
					"name": "Intention of this Optional Rule",
					"entries": [
						"The relationship between warlock and otherworldly patron varies dramatically. When a warlock casts spells using their Charisma, they are effectively saying \"This is my power. It is inherent to my soul. I have purchased it, and it is now separate and distinct from any other. When I grow in power, I may learn from my patron, but even if my patron were gone, I would still be able to grow and advance.\"",
						"Wisdom implies a connection to an external force in most cases. Clerics have a direct connection to their god, and if they were rejected by their deity for some reason, then they would need to find a new one to grant them their abilities. Druids have a similar connection with nature, calling upon it and channeling its power through them. If your warlock has a similar, directly subservient relationship with their patron, it may be fitting to have them use Wisdom instead of Charisma to represent this distinctive change. Note, however, that this is not always appropriate from a gameplay perspective. Wisdom is a more valuable ability score when it comes to saving throws, which makes the warlock somewhat more powerful. While in most cases it should have a limited effect on gameplay, think carefully before allowing this rule."

A rare number call it a spider, sitting within a web of limbs and tentacles, waiting for a fly to stumble upon it. Those who have fallen to madness after seeing the beast multiple times claim all of these answers are wrong, and put forth an even more disturbing hypothesis: There is not merely a single Silent One, but many.

When it is completed, the Gilt from that person flows to the one who is the beneficiary of the oath.",
