						"Slivers are creatures that share a hivemind, which allows them to communicate and share their abilities with other nearby slivers. They evolve by assimilating genetic information from creatures within their surroundings. Slivers have millions of years of evolution behind them and are, in the case of survival capability, the perfect species. They have the ability to colonize planets and possess a social structure which fits their mental capabilities. The origin of the slivers has been lost to time. This doesn't stop the most curious of wizards from trying to research and experiment on them.",
						"Slivers are depicted with an armored vertebrate body, a long, bifurcated whip-like tail, one arm with a single talon for a hand, and a head with an armored crest. Variations on this appearance exist in accordance with the abilities each has to offer the hive.",
						"Their society is based on a caste system in which they can coexist prosperously. It is theorized they don't have emotions and they never retreat unless they know they can't win. The individuals of the lower castes, such as Soldiers, are telepathically connected to the Greater Slivers. The slivers won't hesitate to kill their own kind of any caste should the situation demand it; they are ready to expend thousands of Drones in a diversionary action, or to wipe out their ruling castes to prevent their capture.",
						"Slivers are considered \"superorganisms\", because they do not work for personal benefit but to benefit the hive as a whole. Using telepathy in order to communicate, slivers live and thrive together as one. A lone sliver has very slim chance of survival. For this reason, and its overall dependence on hierarchal relationships, that the sliver is seen as an extension of the hive rather than its own organism.",
						"Death has little meaning to an individual sliver. Combined with the large numbers of Soldiers, they are able to breed, they favor large swarm tactics, and wave attacks to overwhelm their enemies.",

								"A hive usually begins with the Sliver Queen. As her hive grows, it can splinter off into remote colonies. Remote colonies are still apart of the hive, but are driven by greater slivers that are an extension of the queens will."

								"Slivers hunt in packs, as they have superior strength in numbers, especially with a variety of unique evolutions. They like to trap their prey, usually with one of their own as bait, while the rest of the hunting party encircles the pray. Doing their best to wound and capture anything they can get the jump on, especially if it poses a threat to the hive, this usually means a new ability they can extract for the hive.",
								"They apparently fight purely on instinct, and are biologically incapable of surrendering or retreating. However, they are smart enough to know when the enemy has surrendered and take them prisoner."
